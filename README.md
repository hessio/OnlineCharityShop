# Online Charity Shop
An online charity shop app made in Flask

The idea was that the Charity shop would create the Square account so then once the payments are made for the item for sale that the proceeds would go to the charity shop.

The benefit being that you don't have to go to a physical location to donate your items to the charity shop. You just create an online account and post the items you have for sale on the site
